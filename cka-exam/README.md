My Exam Prep:

CNCF Kubernetes Class + labs
K8S The Hard Way run through
Run through all the tasks in the k8s docs
Vim tPractice with systemd, journald, openssl, cfssl, and etcd
Work through the sections in Walidâ€™s github list

Try the following exercises interactively:

Note - there are no answers here on purpose. You should be able to do these yourself using the minimal docs that you are allowed to use during the test. At a minimum this should train you on where to look for this info during the test, without notes.

	- a. Scale this to 4 pods.
	- b. Scale it back to 2 pods.

	- d. Check the status of the upgrade
	- e. How do you do this in a way that you can see history of what happened?

1. Create a service that uses an external load balancer and points to a 3 pod cluster running nginx.
1. Create a horizontal autoscaling group that starts with 2 pods and scales when CPU usage is over 50%.
1. Create a custom resource definition
	a. Display it in the API with curl
1. Create a networking policy such that only pods with the label access=granted can talk to it.
	a. Create an nginx pod and attach this policy to it. 
	b. Create a busybox pod and attempt to talk to nginx - should be blocked
	c. Attach the label to busybox and try again - should be allowed
